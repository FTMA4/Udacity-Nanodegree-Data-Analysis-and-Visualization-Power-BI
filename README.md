Udacity Nanodegree Program - Data Analysis and Visualization with Microsoft Power BI 

 

In this program, I have learned how to use Power BI to become effective at using Power Query, and DAX functions for processing, retrieving, analyzing, and creating advanced visualizations to answer questions and draw conclusions.  

 

Project 1 - Create a Data Model for SSTC 

 

In this project, I have built a Power BI visual report to display my findings for Seven Sages Tea Company (SSTC) that combines information from all over the company. The data model will assist the company's CFO to quickly review and analyze which tea beverages sell well and which ones generate the highest profitability. 

Project 2 â€“ Building a Power BI Report for Waggle 

 

In this project, I have designed and built an interactive Power BI report for Waggle, a start-up company that makes smart devices for pets, to help owners track their activity. Using the provided Lapdog and Lapcat datasets, the report includes a variety of visualizations and incorporates advanced Power BI features.
